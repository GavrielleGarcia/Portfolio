# Ela's Portfoilio 

## Description

This is my first Portfolio. Let's keep in mind that it will be improving over time. In here new works and projects will be added not only Web developer experience but also profesional experience that will be impacting my life until one of my dreams as a Project Manager.

## Challenges

Challenges are always part of the game, right know I am struggling with the mailer for comments. That remains as a challenge that soon will be solved (Hopefully).

## Requirements

* **Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap** 

* **Be deployed to GitHub Pages** 

* **Be responsive**

* **Have a polished UI**

* **Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, and so on)**

* **Have a quality README (including a unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to the deployed application).**

## Webpage Name

Ela Garcia Portfolio

## Wedpage Description

For those who search for new designs and experience with Management, here you will find a place. 
The site is under construction, but it will contain a space to share my thoughts, experience, and tips (advice) that work or did not work for me.

## User Story

I WANT to be able to show my work developed
SO THAT people can see material that might be of their interest.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
